# KamberQuests
 WoW Addon - KamberQuests

Automatically adds and removes quests from being tracked by the blizzard quest tracker based on:

  all quests in your current zone,

  all daily quests regardless of zone,

  all weekly quests regardless of zone,

  all raid quests regardless of zone,

  all dungeon quests regardless of zone,

  all pvp quests regardless of zone,

  all completed quests regardless of zone.

all of these options can be turned on or off independently.

it does not change or replace the actual UI - it just changes which quests are currently tracked when you change zones.

I have not tested this with any add-on that modifies or replaces the Blizzard Quest Tracker.

/kq will open the options panel.
